# Revitalising your frontend workflow with Pattern libraries
<br><br>
<center>A journey in frontend development</center>

------

# But first, a step back&hellip;
You're given a set of Photoshop files for a site you've got to build. What do you do?

* Start at the top of the homepage and work down, writing HTML, CSS and JS in one big go?
* Write all the HTML and _then_ write the CSS because you want to nail the ultimate separation of concerns?
* Try and shoehorn it into Bootstrap because that'll save you time, right?

# Go go go
## You picked an approach and ran with it.
------
# Perfection
## It was awesome to start with. It was the Right Way.
------
# Done
## A few weeks later you've had to do a bit of bodging.
## But that won't happen again. Next time will be different
------
# :shipit:
## You send it to the backend team and move on. Life is good.

# ...
------
# Cue trainwreck
------
# What happened?
## Your work was awesome, where did it go wrong?
------
# You built what you saw, but not what was "meant"
# A snapshot
# A spaghetti monster
------
# Step in: pattern libraries
## AKA:
- Style guides
- Component libraries
- Design systems

_and probably many others_
------
# So what is one? What's the point?

- Self contained patterns promote abstraction, modularity and re-use
- Demo pages promote documentation by default
